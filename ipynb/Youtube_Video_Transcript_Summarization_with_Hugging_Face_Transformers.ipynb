              "'[\" In this tutorial we\\'re going to create a project that\\'s quite popular all over the python ecosystem . The project is youtube video summarization . Unlike most youtube tutorials that take the caption of the youtube video  and then summarize it we are going to actually perform a speech recognition . We\\'re going on to convert the speech the audio into text and then do the summarization.\", \" i\\'m using a google collab environment with jpu so you can see that i have got gpu hardware accelerated on . i would strongly encourage you to subscribe to the channel so that you can get the notification of any new video without further ado let\\'s get started .\", \" The longer the length of your video becomes the longer your summarization task is going to take and also the more expensive your computational resources are going to be what do i mean by that . If your video is one minute maybe your summarizing task will take less than a minute . If you have gpu it\\'s going to get executed faster so the first section of the video which is to download the youtube videos audio is downloaded .\", \" The longer the video becomes the harder the summarization task transcription task transcription tasks everything becomes harder . If you\\'re going to use it only for demo or if you\\'re using it for a hobby project, or university project, make sure that you try it with the smaller audio first and then you can use a longer audio .\", \\' When you want to download audio from youtube you have three two formats one is mp4 the second one is webm so instead of downloading it in web m we are going to download it using mp4 format . Instead of downloading the file download the file in a predefined file name which is yt audio dot mp4 .\\', \\' We are going to use a library called hugging sound hugging sound . hugging sound is a library that wraps around the wave to viktor model model to make it easier for you to do asr . At this point we have successfully managed to finish the first part of our video which is to download audio of the youtube video so that that part is done .\\', \" ugging sound for any language that wave to wake to supports supports but because we are dealing with an english video i\\'m going to use it only for english the first step in this process as every first step you have to install the required library . The required library here is hugging sound i\\'m installing it quiet that\\'s why you don\\'t see a lot of webos comments .\", \\' The collab environments gpu that google gives us for free so here in this step all we are doing is we are assigning device equal to cuda if we have gpu device is equal to cpu . The next thing is we need to download the model that we want this is the point where you decide what language you want to do transcription slash asr for .\\', \\' If your audio is going to be more than one minute you might hit an out of memory error . This is known as oom error . It means for a given computing session you would have a limited amount of ram . But when your audio file size crosses one minute it is more than that you cannot run it on a google collab environment .\\', \\' Audio chunking is the process of clipping or splitting your audio into multiple smaller chunks or smaller pieces and writing them into individual files . If your audio is going to be more than 60 seconds you might hit out of memory error so i would always encourage you to be conservative and then keep it below 60 seconds .\\', \" io chunking that we are currently doing is purely purely based on the time you know it might happen so happen that while you\\'re splitting based on 35 second it is possible that you know the speaker might be speaking something you might be cutting a word into two half if you want to avoid that again there is a very nice solution called vad .\", \\' i have successfully converted my yd audio dot pay which is approximately a three and a half minute audio into seven chunks of 30 seconds . i would call it audio transcription slash asr automated speech recognition so what are we going to do we are going to take all these individual chunks of file and transcribe them into respective text .\\', \" For us to do speech recognition or speech um to text we need to define the files audio files for which we want to do transcription . For that list i\\'m just creating the file names what i\\'m doing is i\\'m creating an empty list where there\\'ll be seven string elements . This list is called audio path this will be given as an input to our model dot transcribe function .\", \" Scribing that you have got is not necessarily a text if i run this quickly transcriptions you would see that it\\'s not just the text you\\'ve got multiple elements here . The next step that we are going to do is to extract the text part from this so i\\'m going to say create a new list called sorry new string called full transcript and for every item in transcription i\\'m taking the items transcription value .\", \" This is not the caption that we download from youtube but indeed the audio transcription or audio speech to recognition or automated speech recognition . The final step is from transformers we are importing pipeline so pipeline makes it really really easier for you to do any nlp task the basic nLP task so here in this case we\\'re going to do summarization .\", \" The default model is the default model but imagine you\\'re going to do this for a different language like i said hindi or english sorry tamil or german or spanish or any other language then you have to define the respective language model here rather than just letting it to download the english model .\", \" A lot of word-based models you cannot give text more than you know 512 um the token site should be 512 . But i\\'m going to also explain you the the the text chunking part let me give a title text . Text chunking before summarization is the easiest way to do summarization .\", \\' io chunking we are going to cut our text into thousand characters . We are actually doing summarization at real time so if you have already enjoyed the video you can stop this video righ . If you have got what is happening in this video, you can stopped this video .\\', \" How to say video this is how you would ideally do if you use my code i\\'m going to say batman okay let me see if i can find something smaller than this batman batman. t now and then go start creating your project just make sure you share the video with your friends but if you want to see whether this project actually works just let\\'s get started .\", \" After i have this video i\\'m going to execute this and i\\'m . going to run this . i would pick this smaller one okay but but an interview . After i give the . permission it\\'s going over it after you do that you\\'re going to come back here don\\'t have to download the model and now we have to do the audio checking process .\", \" The length of this video i think it\\'s four minutes okay so transcription has been successfully done now we are going to extract the full transcript . Someone has been very vocal about being a batman then for pretty mature uh whole life describe the feeling something something something or something .\", \" e are going to take this text and then we\\'re going to do summarization okay i\\'m taking the full transcript doing summarization and let\\'s see what happens this this this part may not be relevant again like i said and this might take a little bit of time because what is what is the length of this lin is alien correct okay it will not run right now because because i\\'m of course okay this is weird memorized text equals let me load it inside this .\", \" The project is complete of course it works so let me tell you where are the places you can do optimization first . When you\\'re going to use this model make sure you use the best wave to wake model .    but i think um batman is two sides of uh drama batsman\\'s born and this is the kind of seed for which everyone else grow .\", \\' The final tip where you can improve the model is rather than just leaving it to the pipeline to download the default model you can also define what kind of model you want . There are certain hyper parameters that you can use like minimum length maximum length and so on so so on and so forth so you you can play with all those things .\\', \\' This google collab notebook will be linked in the youtube description so all you have to do is click a like um if you want to and then just go below the description like below the like button and then click the description and get this google collabb notebook and then play with your own youtube video whenever you want . All the necessary links will be in the  youtube description .\\']'"
